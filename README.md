# cse282 at UC San Diego

Solutions for Rosalind problems asked in the class. Enjoy! Oh by the way, solutions are written in Scala :))

Source code for problem #38 is located in
./rosalind/src/main/scala/tasks/Task38.scala

To test an input file, move it to ./rosalind/main/resources/data.txt
Output file is always ./rosalind/data.out
